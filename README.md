<h1 align='center'> Text to Image DR-GAN</h1>
<h3>The goal of the project was to built a GAN model by conditioning generated images on a text description. A Deep Residual GAN network was implemented to create fine pictures from very latent noise. </h3>
The following is the output when the input text were given as 'a yellow bird' and 'a bird on a branch'.
